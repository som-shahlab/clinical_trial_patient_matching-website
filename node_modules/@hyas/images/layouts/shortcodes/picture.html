{{- /*
Renders an HTML picture element, in multiple formats and sizes, with an optional overlay.

It resolves internal destinations by looking for a matching:

  1. Page resource (an image in the current page bundle)
  2. Section resource (an image in the current section)
  3. Global resource (an image in the assets directory)

It skips the section resource lookup if the current page is a leaf bundle, and
captures external destinations as resources for local hosting. The build will
fail if this shortcode is unable to resolve a destination.

You must place global resources in the assets directory. If you have placed
your resources in the static directory, and you are unable or unwilling to move
them, you must mount the static directory to the assets directory by including
both of these entries in your site configuration:

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'assets'
  target = 'assets'

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'static'
  target = 'assets'

Add this CSS to your site to enable responsive image behavior:

  img {
    height: auto;
    max-width: 100%;
  }

Add this CSS to your site to remove small gaps between adjacent elements:

  img, picture {
    font-size: 0;
  }

This shortcode is a wrapper for, and requires, the picture partial:
<https://www.veriphor.com/articles/images-with-overlays/#partial-source-code>

@context {string} Inner The content between the opening and closing shortcode tags.
@context {string} InnerDeindent The content between the opening and closing shortcode tags with indentation removed.
@context {string} Name The file name of the shortcode template, excluding the extension.
@context {int} Ordinal The zero-based ordinal of the shortcode on the page, or within its parent shortcode.
@context {page} Page A reference to the page containing the shortcode.
@context {map} Params The parameters specified in the opening shortcode tag.
@context {hugolib.ShortcodeWithPage} Parent The context of the parent shortcode.
@context {text.Position} Position The position of the shortcode within the page content.

@method {any} Get Returns the parameter value for the given key (for named parameters) or position (for positional parameters).
@mathod {bool} IsNamedParams Returns true if the shortcode is called with named instead of positional parameters.
@method {maps.Scratch) Scratch Returns a writable Scratch to store and manipulate data.

@param {string} [alt] The img element's alt attribute.
@param {string} [class] The img element's class attribute.
@param {string slice} [formats=webp,jpeg] A comma- or space-delimited list of image formats, ordered by precedence, to use when creating images for the srcset attribute of each source element.
@param {string} [loading=lazy] The img element's loading attribute.
@param {string} [overlay] The path to the overlay image: a page resource, a global resource, or a remote resource.
@param {string} [overlayAnchor=BottomRight] The anchor point of the overlay image. May be one of TopLeft, Top, TopRight, Left, Center, Right, BottomLeft, Bottom, or BottomRight. The value is case-insensitive.
@param {float} [overlayPadding=0.00] The padding around the overlay image, as a percentage of the base image width, between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
@param {float} [overlayWidth=0.20] The width of the overlay image, as a percentage of the base image width, between 0 and 1.
@param {string} src The path to the base image: a page resource, a global resource, or a remote resource.
@param {string} [title] The img element's title attribute.
@param {int} [width] The display width of the image, in pixels, falling back to 100% of the viewport width.

@returns {template.HTML}

@example (required args only)

  {{< picture src="images/zion-national-park.jpg" >}}

@example (all args)

  {{< picture
    alt="Bryce Canyon National Park"
    class="foo"
